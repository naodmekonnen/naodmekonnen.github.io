            <h3>Weekly Blog Sprint 1</h3>
            <h5>What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?</h5>
            Not fully understanding the problem I was trying to solve. Scope was also in issue.
            <h5>What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures), Bootstrap, or Atomic Design?</h5>
            I'd like to be able to better understand how the different groups of data types relate to each other and the different fucntions that can be performed on the data.
            <h5>How does In-Person Bootcamp compare to Remote Onboarding?</h5>
            I prefer the in-person lessons much better. It gave me the chance to work with others and learn from them in ways that I wouldn't have been able to remotely.
            <h5>What is your “Why”?</h5>
            I was never satisfied with the jobs I've had before. I've always wanted something more challenging. My family is another big "why". They continually inspire me to go further.

        <h3>Weekly Blog Sprint 2</h3>    
        <p><div>
            <h5>What did you learn about that helped you understand the development process?</h5>
            I learned more about objects and object notation. I also learned about API's and how to import and display data from API's.
            <h5>What does it mean to develop good code?</h5>
            Good code must be readable, easy to understand and maintain. It should also well planned and written well to fit the larger project.
            <h5>What does it mean to be a good developer?</h5>
            A good developer must be passionate about programming and always be willing to learn. They must have a good understanding of programming fundamentals and willing to help their collegues learn and grow.
            <h5>What is one thing that programmers hate doing?</h5>

          <h4>What is pseudocode?</h4>       
          
          Pseudocode describes the steps that should be taken to solve a problem.
          It outlines the sequence of events that will be executed when a program runs.
          Ideally pseudocode should be language agnostic , but will detail the steps in plain language.
          Pseudocode is the blueprint of the program that will be built.
          Pseudocode is not restricted by any syntax rules but must be clear and concise.

          <h4>How does pseudocode help with programming?</h4>

         Pseudocode helps to work through the logic of the problem before any code is written.
         It helps to create an algorithm that is easier to understand and follow.
         Then the code can be written based on this logic.
         Pseudocode also helps to communicate ideas between programmers and other non-technical stakeholders.
         It helps to make sure that everyone involved is on the same page and
         that the code being written will match the design specifications.
         Pseudocode supports the idea of iterative refinement.
         Starting with the high-level design, followed by detailed pseudocode and then the source code.
         This will help catch any potential errors and could save a great deal of time.
         Iterating through these steps will help in creating clean and efficient code inline with the D.R.Y principle.

        <h4>Weekly Blog Sprint 3</h4>

        <p>
          <h5>Do you think JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries are easy or hard to use? Why?</h5>

          <p>They seem hard at first but I get used to thinking in terms of the libraries, it should be easier. 
           Then I can really appreicate how powerful they are.</p>
          <h5>What Frameworks or Libraries are you interested in learning more about?</h5>
          <p>I'd like to learn more React and have a deeper understanding. Django and ASP.NET</p>
          <h5>Find one emerging JavaScript tool that you would like to learn more about or use in your final project.</h5>
          <p>I have read a little bit about Svelte and it seems to be growing in popularity. 
          I'd like to learn and see if I can use it in my final project</p>
         </p>
    
        <h4>Weekly Blog Sprint 4</h4>
        <h5>What have you learned about CLIs? Do you think they are scary?</h5>
        <p>CLIs let the user type in text commands. So far I've only been able to use it to save and push code, change directory and switch branches as well as
            a few other simple commands. I'm scared that I may type the wrong command and lose progress but I'm getting more comfortable</p>
        <h5>If you were to build a CLI, what would it do?</h5>
        <p>I haven't used CLIs enough to think about advantages and disadvantages but I'd probably make it a little less confusing to use</p>
        <h5>List some ideas that without a Framework, would take you a long time to code</h5>
        <p>I can't think of any particular project at the moment but any project that rerquires scalability would be easier to build with frameworks</p>
