            <br>What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?<br>
            <br>Not fully understanding the problem I was trying to solve. Scope was also in issue.<br>
            <br>What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures), Bootstrap, or Atomic Design?<br>
            <br>I'd like to be able to better understand how the different groups of data types relate to each other and the different fucntions that can be performed on the data.<br>
            <br>How does In-Person Bootcamp compare to Remote Onboarding?<br>
            <br>I prefer the in-person lessons much better. It gave me the chance to work with others and learn from them in ways that I wouldn't have been able to remotely.<br>
            <br>What is your “Why”?<br>
            <br>I was never satisfied with the jobs I've had before. I've always wanted something more challenging. My family is another big "why". They continually inspire me to go further.<br>
