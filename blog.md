**Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?**

_I wasn't sure what to expect during the first week but it's going well
I'd say it has been more challenging than I expected_

**What are you excited or eager to learn more about?**

_I'm eager to get more comfortable with Github and git-flow strategy
I'm looking forward to learning Javascript
I'm excited about becoming a better problem solver_

**What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?**

_I can make a decent Tiramisu_

## Sprint 2
### 09/02/2022

**What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?**

_I'd like to be able to start by automating some simple work tasks and I've also thought about working on a global money transfer system that would reach 
 people in remote and unbanked parts of the world._
 
 **What are you struggling with?**

_I'm currently struggling with time constraints. I'm still working so I haven't spent as much time as I'd like on learning to code._

**How do you solve a problem? **

_I try to break it down into smaller and simpler problems and work my way up._

**What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?**

_I've been searching on google and watching tutorials. I haven't taken advantage of the help channel yet but will do so going forward._
 
## Sprint 3
### 09/09/2022
 
 **What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?**
 
 _These are front end languages that make up the visual components of a website or web app. **HTML** structures the page while **CSS** styles or focuses on the presentations of various elements in the HTML. **Javascript** provides the functionality or interactivity for the page/app._
 _I'm enjoying learning how these three languages work together to provide a seamless user experience._
 
 **What are some objects that your blog incorporates?**
 
 -_heading_<br>
 -_horizontal rule_<br>
 -_unordered lists_
 
 **What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?**
 
 _I think it's a critical component of programming. It helps to articulate the problem and break it down into smaller chunks and from there we can write in plain language what every line of code should do. And it also helps in understanding the sequence of execution for a program or a code block._
