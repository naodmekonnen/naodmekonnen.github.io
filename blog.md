What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?

_I'd like to be able to start by automating some simple work tasks and I'vea also thought about working on a global money transfer system that would reach 
 people in remote and unbanked parts of the world._
 
 What are you struggling with?

_I'm currently struggling with time constraints. I'm still working so I haven't spent as much time as I'd like on learning to code._

How do you solve a problem? 

_I try to break it down into smaller and simpler problems and work my way up._

What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?

_I've been searching on google and watching tutorials. I haven't taken advantage of the help channel yet but will do so going forward._
