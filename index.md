**1.Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?**

_I wasn't sure what to expect during the first week but it's going well_

**2.What are you excited or eager to learn more about?**

_I'm looking to get more comfortable with the Github interface for this week 
   and I'm excited about becoming a better problem solver._

**What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?**

_I can make a decent Tiramisu_
